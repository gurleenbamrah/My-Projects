Details: Since the question asks for displaying at least one follower and at lease one tweet, 
I had to join the follows table with the user table to find users with followers and 
then join it with includes table because that table has information about the tweets 
with writer and has information about the favourite lists. And need to include DISTINCT 
so that we don't get duplicates.
