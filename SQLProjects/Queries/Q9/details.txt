I added small subqueries in the SELECT statement to meet the requirements for the question. Like 
calculating the number of replies to the current tweet and the WHERE statement checks if other 
tweets in the table reference this tweet. Then the second subquery is used to count how many times 
the tweet has been retweeted by checking the retweets table. The last subquery is used to count how
many other tweets mention the same hashtag as the current tweet, it does this by checking mention_has 
in tweets table and checks that hashtag is not NULL.
