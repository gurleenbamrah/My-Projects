agent: ChatGPT, OpenAI. "How to use rank() in sql". Also asked why my query wasn't working:
SELECT t.writer, t.tdate, t.ttime, t.text, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(r.retweeter) DESC) AS ranking
FROM tweets t
JOIN retweets r ON t.writer = r.writer 
AND t.tdate = r.tdate 
AND t.ttime = r.ttime
GROUP BY t.writer, t.tdate, t.ttime, t.text
WHERE ranking <= 3;
Reply from AI to fix this was to add it as a subquery because we need rank() to be calculted
first before WHERE and right now the contents in WHERE is calculated before SELECT so the query 
is not getting solved and rank() is not being used correctly. 

Details: The subquery in the sql, I first joined the tweets with their matching retweets by the writer 
and then with the dates and times to match the tweets with the retweets. it basically just checks how many 
people retweeted each tweet based on finding out who tweeted it and when. then I implement the rank() function 
which ranks the tweet based on how many retweets they have (using COUNT()) and if 2 retweets are given the same 
number then they're given same rank, thats why using rank is helpful for ties. then the outer query only selects 
the top 3 tweets or more because of ties.
