agent: ChatGPT OpenAI. My prompt: "How do I use case insensitive in SQL", I added LOWER() to my sql to complete the requirement
Details: The first join statement joins the follows table with the users table so we can match the follower's user information. 
The second join checks if same followees is in both tables and that both followers and following the same user (u2). The third join, 
joins the second table to identify the second follower (John Doe). Used LOWER() to complete the requirement for case insensitive part 
of the question. the WHERE and last AND statement checks that user has followed u2 for at least 90 days and john dow has followed u2 
for less than 90 days.
