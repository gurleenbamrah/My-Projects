agent: Asked ChatGPT, OpenAI. "Why is my query not working according to the question"
The query I have:
WITH counting_tweets AS (
    SELECT strftime('%m', tdate) AS month_number, COUNT(*) - COUNT(replyto_w) AS tweet_count, COUNT(replyto_w) AS reply_count
    FROM tweets
    WHERE strftime('%Y', tdate) = '2024'
    GROUP BY month_number
),
counting_retweets AS (
    SELECT strftime('%m', rdate) AS month_number,COUNT(*) AS retweet_count 
    FROM retweets
    WHERE strftime('%Y', rdate) = '2024'
    GROUP BY month_number
)
SELECT ct.month_number, ct.tweet_count, ct.reply_count, ct.retweet_count,(ct.tweet_count + ct.reply_count + cr.retweet_count) AS total
FROM counting_tweets ct
LEFT JOIN counting_retweets cr ON ct.month_number = cr.month_number
ORDER BY ct.month_number;

Reply from AI was that i needed to add COALESCE() to my query and that is why my query wasn't passing the
tests on Github, after adding it my query passed the test. 

Details:
First I made a CTE for counting tweets by first getting the month from the tweets table. Then counting
all rows and count rows where replyto_w is not null and then get the difference for that which gives 
replyto_w where it is null. I also counted the rows where replyto_w is not null giving us tweets that are
replies. then filter for the year 2024 and group by month. The second CTE is started by getting the month
from retweets table and then counting the number of retweets each month. Then filtering for year 2024 and 
group by month. then outside the CTE everything that the question wants printed is stated in the SELECT 
statement. I orginally had something different for this statement because I did not know what COALESCE()
was , so I went to of the attached link given to us in question 2 to learn about it to add to the query.
This function makes sure that if there is no retweet data for a given month, it returns 0 instead of 
NULL. So total calculates the total activity for the month by adding tweet cound, reply count and retweet
but using COALESCE() for retweet. Then I left join to make sure that months without retweets are included
and everything is ordered by month.
