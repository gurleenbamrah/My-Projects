First I joined follows and users tables and this gives us a list of all users who are followed by other. Then I used HAVING to
filter the results to include only those users who have the max number of followers. The subquery finds the amx follower count.
Then the second bit of the query uses HAVING to filter to include only those writers whose average number of retweets matches 
the maximum average retweets count. Then the subquery in this finds the maximum average retweet count. Both the querys are 
combined by a UNION statment to make the final query. The query outputs user who is the top in followers and also user who is 
top in retweets.
