ChatGPT, OpenAI. "Why is my query not working". query that i gave chatgpt to check:
SELECT l.owner, l.lname, COUNT(*) AS total_tweets, COUNT(r.retweeter) AS retweeted_tweets
FROM lists l
JOIN includes i ON l.owner = i.owner AND l.lname = i.lname
JOIN tweets t ON i.writer = t.writer AND i.tdate = t.tdate AND i.ttime = t.ttime
JOIN retweets r ON t.writer = r.writer AND t.tdate = r.tdate AND t.ttime = r.ttime
GROUP BY l.owner, l.lname
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 
AND COUNT(r.retweeter) / COUNT(*) >= 0.5;

Reply from Chatgpt was that I am using the JOIN incorrect, that I should use LEFT JOIN and said that my
statement in AND is wrong because I'm calculating it wrong.

Details: 
After trying to finish the question without CTE, I failed and then tried it using CTE. I created 
a table called ListTweet, in the table I counted the number of tweets and also counted how many tweets 
have been retweeted. Then I joined the lists table with the includes table so then we only get the tweets
included in a specific list. Then I joined includes table with the tweets table, so this table matches 
the tweets based on who wrote the tweet and the date and time. The I left joined with the retweets table,
so this finds out if each tweets have been retweeted by matching writer, date, time of the tweet. Outside
the table I find out only the lists that have more than 3 tweets in the WHERE statement. In the AND 
statement I check that the number of retweeted tweets is half or more of the total tweets. Like if there
are 6 tweets in a list then at least 3 will be retweeted.
