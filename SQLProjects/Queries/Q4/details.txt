Details: First I had to left join tweets table and users table to check if a user has 
written any tweets and then only include users who have no tweets then in the subquery, 
the first part finds all the users that John Doe follows. the second part with the except 
takes out the users that the current user doesn't follow. and I also used LOWER() again 
because the question says case-insensitive.
