Details: Finds users who have posted at least 3 distinct tweets mentioning 'Edmonton' and I do this by 
checking 3 tweets from the same user. and then checks if the things in the tweet are different 
by text or the date it is posted. I used LOWER() again because this question also requires 
case-insensitive. After all this I use EXCEPT for no followers requirement.
